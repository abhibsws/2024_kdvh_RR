## Abstract

We study the recently-proposed hyperbolic approximation of the Korteweg-de Vries
equation (KdV). We show that this approximation, which we call KdVH, possesses
a rich variety of solutions, including solitary wave solutions that approximate
KdV solitons, as well as other solitary and periodic solutions that are related to
higher-order water wave models, and may include singularities.
We analyze a class of implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta time discretizations for KdVH
that are asymptotic preserving, energy conserving, and can be applied to other
hyperbolized systems. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
these discretizations.
